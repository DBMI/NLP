To run pyConTextWeb execute the following command:

	twistd -ny server.py

A web browser will appear with the url of http://localhost:8095/. 
NOTE:
	Django's urls.py error message will appear, prompting the user that the current page does not exist. This will occur until the issue with server.py on line 49 is  resolved.

Navigate your web browser to http://localhost:8095/pyConTextKit, and provide correct details for login.

If you do not have an account you can create one by executing the following serires of commands in the directory pyConTextWeb:

	python manage.py shell
	>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	>> user = User.objects.create_user('<Name>','<Email>','<Password>')
	>> user.save()

If you would like to elevate your user's permissions you can do so by setting the permission's variable.
	>>user.is_superuser = True
	>>user.save()

More information about Django users can be found here, http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth
