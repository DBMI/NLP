To run pyConTextWeb execute the following command:

	sudo twistd -ny server.py

A web browser will appear with the url of http://localhost:8095/. 

NOTE --
	Django's urls.py error message will appear, prompting the user that the current page does not 
	exist. This will occur until the issue with server.py on line 49 is  resolved.
	
	If your media (e.g. CSS stylesheets or images, etc...) are not loading refer to the MEDIA_URL 
	variable in settings.py and change the port to 8095 for running the project in twisted and to
	port 8000 for running the project in Django's build in webserver.

Navigate your web browser to http://localhost:8095/pyConTextKit, and provide correct details for login.

If you do not have an account you can create one by executing the following series of commands in the 
directory pyConTextWeb:

	python manage.py shell
	>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	>> user = User.objects.create_user('<Name>','<Email>','<Password>')
	>> user.save()

If you would like to elevate your user's permissions you can do so by setting the permission's variable.
	>>user.is_superuser = True
	>>user.save()

More information about Django users can be found here, http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth
