THIS IS A FAKE HEADER THAT LEE ADDED

Titus:	Hi, Diane, this is Titus.  I know you can't recognize me now.  
This is Kim, our patient for today.  Wake up, Kim.  
She's also my office coordinator so usually she has a much a easier job 
than this one.  

I'm going to do the exam like I normally would do.  



	I'm going to be maybe a little bit more verbose than I typically would be but just kind of representative of what would happen in real dental practice.  So first question, why are you here today?



Kim:	I am here today because I have a chipped crown.



Titus:	Okay.  



Kim:	Probably a few cavities and possibly a problem with another crown by ?   



Titus:	Okay.



Kim:	I'm not sure.



Titus:	Where's the crown that is chipped?



Kim:	They're both in the back.  



Titus:	In the lower jaw?



Kim:	And I think it is the one in the back.  



Titus:	Okay.  



Kim:	From the front.  They're kind of ? they're two side by sides so it just feels like one big group.



Titus:	All right.  When was your last visit to a dentist?  You can be honest.



Kim:	It's about now ? actually, I'm about six months overdue in my cleaning.  So I guess it's been about a year.



Titus:	Okay.  Any major problems during those last visits?



Kim:	He filled a cavity up ? on that side.  



Titus:	All right.  But mostly it was for cleanings?



Kim:	Yes.



Titus:	Okay.  All right.  I'm going to start with an external oral exam, meaning I'll just look from the outside and then we're gonna look at your gums, your cheeks, tongue and so on and then, finally, I'll look at your teeth.  



	Have you had any pain ? areas of pain recently?



Kim:	No.  Actually the pain ? I was having pain with the crowns and then ? it seems like it comes and goes.  Like it'll hurt for a couple of months and then you won't have it for like three or four months.  And so just ? it comes and goes all the time.



Titus:	All right.  



Kim:	But I've had a little bit of pain up here and I don't know if that's because these are cavities.



Titus:	We'll find that out now, I guess



Titus:	Okay.  Look at me for a second.  Okay.  I'm just gonna palpate some of the areas on your face.  If anything hurts, just tell me.  So the patient's symmetry is normal.  No problems with palpation on the ramus.  Sublingually, nothing.  No submental lymph nodes.  



	I'm gonna palpate your muscles on this side.  Can you turn your head to the right a little bit?  Still Sternostonetis____.  It's fine.  Okay.  No cervical lymph nodes.  You can turn to the other side.  Right side Sternostonetis also fine.  No cervical lymph nodes.  And look straight again.  Okay.  No pain or pressure on the Fausam.  Did you ever do something to your nose?



Kim:	Yes.  Skating.  Fell on the barrier.



Titus:	That's what I thought.  Okay.



Kim:	And one car accident.  



Titus:	Okay.  So we have a slight left deviation of the nasal cartilage in the upper third of the nose.  Okay?  All right.  I'm going to palpate the temporal muscles.  No pain there?



Kim:	Un-uh.  



Titus:	Okay.  The masseter?  No pain when I do that?



Kim:	Un-uh.  



Titus:	Okay.  Do me one favor and swallow.  And once again.  Okay.  Thyroid feels normal.  Can you put your head ? slightly on to your ? like forward like that.  Okay, just rechecking submental and, submandibular lymph nodes.  No other findings.  



	You can relax.  Skin tone normal and no obvious dermatologic problems.  You have some slight scaling of your chin.  Do you know ??



Kim:	Retin-A.  



Titus:	Okay.  So we have that.  All right.  Let's take a look at your gums and soft tissues.  ____ inspection, as I take a look around and, if I see anything, we'll note that down.  The left buccal mucosa and cheek area appear normal.  Vestibulum and the mandibular also normal.  If you can turn a little bit towards me.  



	There's a slight white plaque about two millimeters in diameter, irregularly shaped, near the area of Tooth No. 31 in the vestibulum.  It cannot be wiped off.  I think that's about it.  I want to check that on the other side.  Okay.  



	Sublingual aspects mandibular appears ? mandibular mucosa and gums appear normal.  Okay.  Let's take a look in the maxilla.  Maxillary mucosa is within normal limits.  Retromolar pad on the left-hand side is normal.  Can you close just slightly.  A little bit ? just keep open just a little bit.  Yeah, perfect.  Okay.  



	Mastibular area looks normal.  Can you turn?  All right.  Turn around a little bit.  Mastibular area on the right-hand side also normal.  Retromolar pad within normal limits.  Kim, can you open again?  And look straight ahead.  All right.  Now open wide.  Can you say ?ah??  



Kim:	Ah.



Titus:	Yeah, then one more time.



Kim:	Ah.  



Titus:	Okay, the pharynx area looks normal.  Okay.  And let me check for oral cancer ? this is an oral cancer screening.  If you stick out your tongue?  Perfect.  I'm gonna look at your tongue from all sides.  Tongue right lateral border and body is normal.  Left lateral border also normal.  Okay.  If you can put it back.  Okay.  And then touch the roof of your mouth with your tip to your tongue.  Okay.  Ventral aspect of the tongue is normal.  Okay, and then relax your tongue again.  And dorsal aspect of the tongue is also normal.  Okay.  



	I'm going to palpate these areas.  Now if anything hurts, just tell me.  I'm just gonna run my finger around and see whether I can feel anything out of the ordinary.  On palpation, mandibular vestibulum normal.  The lingual sides normal.  No tworeye.  No places that are hardened or tuberosities.  Okay, this feels normal.  



	Can you close just slightly?  Maxilla vestibular area is fine.  Okay.  And close all the way.  And can you just look at me straight for a second.  Okay.  Just open your mouth slowly and close it.  And open.  A little bit wider, as wide as you can.  And close it.  And open once again.  



	Okay, there's a slight left evasion of the mandibular to the left ? into the left side, approximately four millimeters on maximum opening.  And you can close again.  And the mandibular midline is shifted by about two millimeters compared to the maxilla midline.  Okay.  Can you open again and close?  



Male #1:	Can you say that again?  Sorry.  



Titus:	The mandibular midline is shifted about two millimeters compared to the maxilla midline.  And close again.  And open.  And close.  No evidence or clicks or Protestis in the TMJ upon opening.  You've never had any problems with your TMJ?  Or have you?  



Kim:	I ? it comes and goes.



Titus:	Okay.



Kim:	I'd say in the last five years.  I think it's here somewhere.



Titus:	And what kind of problems do you get when it comes?



Kim:	Just the clicking sound.  



Titus:	Okay.  So you kind of hear it click?



Kim:	Yeah.



Titus:	Do you have pain in the area?



Kim:	No, you just ? see it like here and kind of ? and feel it click.  


Titus:	Oh, okay.



Kim:	But it's nothing, then it goes away.



Titus:	And how often do you say does that happen?  About once a year or so



Kim:	Yeah.  I would say ? yeah.  



Titus:	Is there anything that precipitates it?  Or it just comes by itself.  



Kim:	I had it really bad five years ago and I went on the internet and found out that you shouldn't have bagels and carrots and all that and, I am not kidding, I ? that's what I was eating all week.  And when I stopped it, it decreased.  I am not kidding.  



Titus:	Okay.



Kim:	Cause they said that certain ?



Titus:	All right.  



Kim:	Things can trigger it.  I'm not kidding.



Titus:	Bagels and carrots.  I have to watch that.  



Kim:	I'm serious.  I really did.  I thought ? and it helped because it's stopped.  



Titus:	Okay.  All right.  That sounds somewhat unrelated to each other but who knows.



Kim:	Yeah.  I don't know.  That's what they said.  Bagels can trigger it, I guess.  I don't know.



Titus:	Okay.  It might actually be more the chewing that you're ? the hard chewing you do when you eat bagels.  



Kim:	Yeah.  Well, I had ?



Titus:	I mean bagels aren't that easy to chew.



Kim:	Bags of those little baby carrots, too.



Titus:	Okay.  All right.  Well, you avoided one health problem and now you're not gonna see as well.  Okay.  



Kim:	Cooked carrots.  



Titus:	I'm gonna look at your teeth finally.  So I'm just gonna put you back and make sure the camera still is on us.  Because we're gonna shift positions slightly.  



Female #1:	Yeah, you may have to ?



Titus:	Okay. Im going to put you back a little bit more.  If there's any discomfort while I do probing or so, just raise your left hand.  



Kim:	Okay.  



Titus:	You don't have to kick your feet like with your other dentist.  



Kim:	No.  That might happen.  



Titus:	And I promise I won't yell at you either.  Okay.  Okay.  Open.  Okay.  No. 1 is missing.  Two occlusal distal amalgam.  Actually, make that occlusal.  Also, one palatal amalgam.  Those look okay.  Can you close just slightly?  And perfect.  Okay, now open again.  



	No. 3 looks fine although the mesiobuccal cusp has some abrasion on the top of the cusp.  There's some bleeding points there so we'd have to check whether that's idiopathic grinding or whether that's iatrogenic.  Four looks fine.  Five is fine.  Six is fine.  Seven and eight fine.  



	Eight mesio might have a slight translucency, so this might actually be a caries.  We should check that out on the radiograph, which we actually don't have.  So.  But it's something we should check out.  The same goes for nine, also a mesio translucency.  



	Ten is fine.  Eleven is fine.  Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fine.  Fifteen has one occlusal amalgam with slightly compromised margins but that may not be a cause for concern.  Can you close just slightly?  Perfect.  Okay.  Let's move onto the lower jaw.  That would be 17.  



Male #1:	Sixteen is missing?  



Titus:	Oh, yeah.  Sixteen is missing.  Yep.  Thank you for reminding me.  Seventeen is missing.  Eighteen, slightly stained fissures. Nineteen is an occlusal amalgam.  Nineteen, distal slight roughness in approximately but we would have to check on the radiograph whether there's anything worthwhile.  From then on, everything is okay.  All teeth present to 24.  Slight staining on lower front on the lingual side.  No evidence of calculus.  



Male #1:	Which one?  Twenty-four?  



Titus:	Actually, it's mostly 25.  



Male #1:	Say again?  Staining.



Titus:	Yeah, staining.  But there's no evidence of calculus.  



Male #1:	Which  buccal or ?



Titus:	Lingual.  



Male #1:	Lingual.  



Titus:	Twenty-eight and 29 are okay.  Thirty is a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown.  Can you just swallow for a second?  Do you recall, by any chance, how old that crown is?  The one you have crowned here?



Kim:	They're very close in ? when I had m wisdom teeth, so I think maybe my 39th.  Thirty-three?  



Titus:	Okay, which would be how many years ago?



Kim:	That was about seven years ago.



Titus:	Okay.  



Kim:	Yeah.



Titus:	All right.  Okay.  Some of the margins on the crown 31 have a catch but currently I cannot detect any secondary caries.  It looks like the crown is still functional.  And we have ? did I just say 30 or 31?



Male #1:	Thirty-one.  



Titus:	Okay.  That was wrong.  It's 30.  Then we have 31, also a PFM crown.  The distal cusp of the crown is fractured off and metal framework is visible.  Does this hurt?



Kim:	Tenderness.



Titus:	Okay.  



Male #1:	On the visible?  



Titus:	The gingiva on the buccal side of 31 is slightly sensitive.  It's also slightly erythematous with a small amount of bleeding on probing.  



Kim:	Uh-huh.



Titus:	And you feel that, too?



Kim:	Uh-huh.



Titus:	Okay.  And the same applies on the lingual side of the crown.  We also have slight sensitivity and some plaque.  Also, the mucosa is somewhat ? covers the distal aspect of the crown up to the marginal ridge.  And 32 is missing.  And you said all your ? all four wisdom teeth were taken out?  



Kim:	At the same time.  And the crown was put in the same day, too.  



Titus:	Okay.



Kim:	So the back crown ? actually, it was, I think, the back crown was first and then there was such a gap between my back crown and the tooth ?



Titus:	Yeah.  



Kim:	Or maybe this one was put in first.  



Titus:	Yeah.



Kim:	I guess it was put in first and then there was such a large gap, he said that your back tooth is going to need a crown anyway.  So to fix that gap, he just added another crown.



Titus:	Okay.



Kim:	Which I probably really didn't need a crown.



Titus:	And the fracture of that crown happened when the surgery had happened, right?



Kim:	No, no, no.  That just ? it just happened just like a month ? just like three weeks ago.  So I mean uh-huh.



Titus:	Oh, wow.



Kim:	a random thing.  Are my teeth falling out?  



Titus:	I thought it was something I said.



Kim:	No.  It just ?



Titus:	Okay.



Kim:	That crack just ? yeah.  



Titus:	in general the crown itself is still fine in that area.  Things like that happen all the time with ceramic crowns because they tend to fracture more than, for instance, full gold crowns but they've no access to your tooth itself.  Like it's still ? the metal is still there.  



Kim:	Good.



Titus:	So it's something most people complain about in terms of aesthetics.  Since it's on the back tooth and probably few people ever look that far back, I would actually leave it.  What is more of a concern for me is your gingival condition in that area.  So we'd have to kind of take a more detailed look at what that is.  



Kim:	Yeah, I never had that until I had the crown.  But ?



Titus:	Yeah, that typically does happen though.  



Kim:	Okay.



Titus:	Okay.  Now I'm gonna check the perio condition of your tooth, of your teeth.  So I'm gonna do a pocket measurement first.  I'm just gonna do all measurements rather than a screening exam and ? because it's the first time you're in this office and we need to get a comprehensive status.  If you can close just slightly.  Okay.  



	Two disto facial.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Three.  Two.  Two.  One.  Three.  Two.  Two.  Two.  One.  One.  Two.  Two.  One.  Two.  Two.  One.  Two.  This is the midline.  



	Okay, can you open again?  There's no evidence of ? no direct evidence of plaque.  We have bleeding point at three on the mesial aspect of the tooth and then between six and seven in approximal line.  And also four distal is one bleeding point.



Male #1:	Can you repeat that, sir?  



Titus:	I can't because I don't remember.  



Male #1:	Okay.



Titus:	That's okay, it's on the tape.  We can look at it on the tape.  



Male #1:	All right.  



Titus:	Did you just brush your teeth?



Kim:	Uh-huh.  



Titus:	Okay.  That's why.  There's no evidence of plaque on the facial side of the left upper quadrant.  Okay, I'm gonna do the same thing on the lingual side.  Okay, that's a three.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Three.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  And two, two, two and a two.  Okay.  Okay.  



	On the lingual side of the upper right quadrant, there's light accumulation of plaque on Tooth No. 2.  That's about it.  Bleeding point.  Three mesio.  Five mesio.  Six mesio.  And seven and eight mesio.  Okay.  So if I was gonna do the whole exam, we'd do this with every single quadrant.  



	In the interest of time, we're just gonna do one because it's the same.  We're gonna check the tooth mobility.  Okay, no variable mobility on any of the teeth.  I'm just ? do a percussion test on the two crowns.  Any of this feel funny?



Kim:	Nope.



Titus:	Okay.  All right.  And if you can close for me one more time?  All right.  Occlusion is Class 2 on the right-hand side.  And open again.  And close.  And also Class 2 on the left-hand side.  Okay, open again.  Does this hurt?  In this area?



Kim:	Un-uh.  I don't even feel that.  



Titus:	Okay.  It's that white spot that I saw in the beginning so actually on closer look it's not really a white spot.  It's just in the area where the blood vessels aren't as dense as any other area.  



Kim:	I mean it really feels numb.



Titus:	Feels numb?



Kim:	I don't even feel you really touching the outer areas.



Titus:	It might be underlying scar tissue from your surgery.  



Kim:	Oh.



Titus:	So it's nothing to worry about.  Okay.  That was the exam.  So for the free dental advice that I promised, the only area of concern is really that crown on the right-hand side.  There is more plaque around that tooth than around the other teeth so part of the problem why the gingivitis inflamed there is because there is more of a plaque accumulation.  



	So when you brush, one of the things is you probably avoid that area right now a little bit because it does hurt when you brush.  So it's actually an area where you should kind of carefully clean a little bit more because that'll reduce the plaque and that will reduce the inflammation and that way, the area is not as sensitive.  



	Does the area feel sensitive when you drink or eat or is it just when you kind of touch it or when I touch it?



Kim:	Actually, I think with the eating off and on which I tend to use this side



Titus:	To favor the other side.  



Kim:	Yeah.  Yeah.



Titus:	Okay.  All right.  But otherwise, there's not much of concern.  Normally, you can take an X-ray for your two front teeth.  Right now ? I'm not sure ? clinically, it looks like there might be something but we would know that only with more confidence if we took an X-ray.  



	So that's about it.  So you can just wait until you get your card from your dentist and get your teeth cleaned again and meanwhile, I'll try to ?



Kim:	Keep sending me a reminder.  (Laughter)



Titus:	Yeah.  All right.  That was it.  Bye, Diane.
