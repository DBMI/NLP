Attend: **NAME[VVV, UUU]
CONSULTS:  Infectious disease, Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS]/Dr. **NAME[RRR].
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Infectious diarrhea.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a **AGE[in teens]-year-old previously healthy male 
admitted because of sudden onset of bloody diarrhea on the day of admission 
after eating 3 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  He is from Tennessee and 
is in **PLACE as part of a youth church group, and was at a camp when this 
happened.  This is the first episode of bloody diarrhea.  He presented to the 
emergency room, and was subsequently admitted.  CT scan of the abdomen showed 
no acute inflammatory process.  Cultures of the blood, stool, and urine were 
obtained, as well as a culture for C. difficile.  An infectious disease 
consult was sent at the emergency room, and we were advised not to give him 
any antibiotics or antidiarrheals until the culture results are available.  
Hydration was continued.  The patient also had nausea and vomiting initially, 
but throughout the next hospital day, he was able to tolerate his food.
Throughout the next hospital days, he still had some bloody diarrhea.  This 
eventually slowed down on the third hospital day, which was the day of 
discharge.  Eventually, cultures of the stool did not show any E. coli.  He 
was negative for C. difficile.  This was a concern because of previous 
antibiotic use for acne.  He was stable throughout his hospital course.  He 
was afebrile, and white count went back to normal.  On discharge, the patient 
was stable.  Diarrhea has been resolved.  He is instructed to follow up with 
his primary care physician in 2-4 weeks.  Per ID's recommendations, no 
antibiotics will be given because of the negative cultures and clinical 
improvement.
No discharge medications were given.
