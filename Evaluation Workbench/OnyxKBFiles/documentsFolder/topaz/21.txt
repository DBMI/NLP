DISCHARGE SUMMARY
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[BBB, CCC]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
**ROOM
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  DANY H ISSA
ADMISSION DATE:  **DATE[Oct 29 2008]
DISCHARGE DATE:  **DATE[Nov 12 2008]
The patient presented with septic picture, was diagnosed with CMV colitis and 
Shigella bacteremia on the background of a new diagnosis of HIV.  He was 
treated with IV valacyclovir in addition to IV ceftriaxone with good 
response; his diarrhea abated.  He was seen in consult by Infectious Disease. 
 Today, he is tolerating p.o.  He is moving his bowels 4 to 5 times a day 
with a good appetite.  He is not dizzy, and he is able to ambulate.  We will 
discharge him today.  I discussed the case with Infectious Disease doctor 
on-call, Dr. __________. 
His discharge medications will include,
1. Bactrim DS prophylaxis 1 tablet a day.
2. Ferrous sulfate 3 to 5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Cipro 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Valganciclovir 900 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Over-the-counter multivitamin.
We made him an appointment at the **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Nov 19 2008].  I 
encouraged him to be compliant with appointment and to take his medications 
as prescribed meticulously.  He will continue on Cipro for a total of 2 
weeks; however, that could be changed depending on the clinical information 
that might become available to the PACT clinic.  I advised him about that. 
I also advised him that valganciclovir probably is going to be for a few 
weeks, and that is again to be decided by the PACT group.
