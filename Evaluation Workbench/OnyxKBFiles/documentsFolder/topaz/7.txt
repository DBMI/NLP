PROGRESS NOTE
His organism came back as Shigella, so he had Shigella dysentery and septic
shock, which have improved. We have not had to give him anymore volume
boluses. We have been able to wean him off his epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and milrinone. He is also off of his hydrocortisone and is feeling better now
that he is awake and oriented. He tells me that he was walking through what
sounds like raw sewage around the household that he was staying at Korea. So
it is consistent with the Shigellosis.

I have examined this critically ill child, titrated critical care therapies
for a billing of 60 minutes.
