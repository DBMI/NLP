Calls-Consults: Called and spoke to Endocrine Fellow Dr. **NAME[UUU] who
recommended 10 cc/kg bolus followed by D5 1/2 NS + 20 KCl at 1.5 maintaince.
Initially gave 15 units of lantis followed by 4 units of humalog.  Zofran 4 mg
for abdominal pain.  Sent stool studies and C diff toxin for blood in
diarrhea.  Initial i stat showed ketosis without DKA.  As patient was seen in
ED at **PLACE and had to return again today, decided best to admit to Endo
service for continued fluids overnight and close glocuse monitoring..
