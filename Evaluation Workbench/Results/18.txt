The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old lady who is visiting **PLACE from her home 
town (_______________) in Massachusetts.  She had longstanding periods of 
alternating diarrhea and constipation.  She had a colonoscopy done in 
**DATE[Aug 2006] which per the patient is essentially unremarkable.  The 
patient now presents to our emergency room with a 4 to 5 days history of 
worsening diarrhea.  At its worse, on Sunday, she had 7 to 8 loose bowel 
movements that day, she also had a low-grade temperature at that point in 
time.  Also, throughout this time, she has been having decreased p.o. intake. 
At the time of presentation, she had about 6 to 8 green bowel movements with 
specks of blood identified on the tissue paper.  She said she has a known 
history of hemorrhoids that sometimes act up with her aggravating diarrhea 
and at the time of admission, she also complained of lower abdominal 
discomfort.  In the emergency room when she was evaluated, she was afebrile, 
and she was orthostatic at that point in time.  Rest of her exam essentially 
was unremarkable including an abdominal exam which revealed an obese abdomen 
without any masses, visceromegaly, and tenderness.  Per ED documentation, she 
was guaiac-negative.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed showed 
diffuse thickening of the colon with changes suggestive of colitis, possibly 
infectious in etiology.  She had degenerating myomas of the uterus, 
moderate-sized hiatal hernia on CT as well, had some lesions in the liver 
which per the radiologist were benign consistent with hemangiomas.  No pelvic 
adenopathy was appreciated.  On exam, her hemoglobin was 12.6, and her white 
cell count was 6.7.  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of diarrhea 
secondary to colitis.  The cause was thought to be most likely bacterial.  
Also, the patient was hypotensive, and she was adequately fluid resuscitated 
with boluses of fluid after which she was kept on maintenance fluid.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  During her hospital stay, the patient was aggressively 
hydrated.  Gastroenterology was consulted who reviewed the stool studies 
which was sent, these were stool culture which showed normal bowel flora.  
There were no white cells in the stools.  A C. difficile toxin was sent which 
was negative.  Blood cultures were sent.  They also came back negative.  A CT 
was also reviewed as dictated above.  During her hospital stay, the patient's 
diarrhea improved.  At the day of discharge, she had 2 bowel movements.  The 
patient did not complain of any nausea or vomiting, and she was tolerating 
her meals.  She remained afebrile.  She never had an elevated white cell 
count during this admission.  Gastroenterology only wanted to scope her if 
the workup was negative, and the patient's symptoms persisted.  The patient 
was seen on **DATE[May 28 2007].  At that time, her condition was stable, and it 
was considered appropriate to discharge her.  We (_______________) the 
patient that if her symptoms recur that she should return to her PCP or 
gastroenterologist and we can look into further causes of her diarrhea.  At 
this point in time, she however, is stable and her symptoms have subsided.

etiology.  However, it seems that the infection is noninvasive.
