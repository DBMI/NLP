HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
 
Ms. **NAME[BBB] is a **AGE[in teens]-year-old African American female who presented to 
**INSTITUTION Emergency Department on **DATE[Aug 04], 2008 with 
complaints of abdominal pain with diarrhea and vomiting x1 week.  The patient 
also reports poor appetite with poor p.o. intake, as well as abdominal pain 
with cramping.  The patient was seen at **INSTITUTION approximately 2 
weeks ago for a pharyngitis with throat culture found to be negative.  The 
patient does complain of fever and chills with a temperature as high as 104 
two days prior to admission.  The patient also reported urinary symptoms with 
increase in urinary frequency and burning.  The patient was diagnosed with a 
UTI one week prior to admission, but did not take antibiotic secondary to 
inability to keep the medicine down.  The patient denied any chest pain, 
cough, or shortness of breath.   
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 
1. SLE diagnosed in 2004.
2. Asthma.
3. Anemia.
4. ITP.
5. Genital warts with laser ablation done on **DATE[Aug 06], 2008.
6. Migraine headaches.
 
 
ALLERGIES:
 
1. Bactrim with reaction of hives.
2. Pineapple with reaction of rash.
 
HOSPITAL COURSE:
 
1.   GI:
 
The patient was admitted with approximately a 2-week history of abdominal 
pain with diarrhea.  Stool cultures were done that were negative for 
salmonella, shigella, fibro pseudomonas and staph; however, they were 
positive for Shigatoxins 1 and 2.  HSV cultures were done that were negative, 
both from the throat and vagina.  An ID consult was obtained for not only the 
abdominal pain and diarrhea, but patient also reported mouth ulcerations.  It 
was infectious disease's opinion given her problem of intermittent vomiting 
and diarrhea and positive stool cultures for Shigatoxins (It was of note too 
that other family members also had similar symptoms), the patient was given 
IV support and symptom management as this did not require any other treatment 
for that.  The mouth ulcers were felt to be as a result of viral and cultures 
were taken for herpes that were negative.  A third issue with infectious 
disease also included an ulceration in the vaginal area that could be either 
considered posttraumatic related to recent laser wart removal or herpetic 
ulcer given its painful nature.  Again, cultures for HSV vaginally were 
negative.   
 
The patient did have an issue with vaginal discharge that was consistent with 
bacterial vaginosis.  The patient will be given a 7-day course of 
metronidazole with the recommendation per infectious disease for HIV 
screening as she is a high risk sexual exposure.   
 
Also, related to infectious disease the patient had a positive urinalysis, 
but no urine culture and the patient did receive 2 days of ciprofloxacin.  It 
was infectious disease's recommendation that they discontinue the Cipro due 
to risk of hemorrhagic colitis, as well as hemolytic syndrome related to use 
of antibiotics.   
 
By the time of discharge the patient was feeling well and her abdomen was 
nontender and tolerating p.o. well and diarrhea had subsided.   
 
A GI consult was obtained too and they agreed with the supportive care plan 
from infectious disease and primary, as well as holding the Cipro antibiotic. 
 They felt it was very little utility in obtaining an EGD since the pain was 
all oropharyngeal at this point and the patient's LFTs had normalized at time 
of discharge. 
 
2.   RHEUMATOLOGY:
 
The patient has a history of SLE and was followed by rheumatology.  The 
patient currently will be off methotrexate and continued on her Plaquenil.  
Due to the recent viral hepatitis, rheumatology recommended holding off on 
any hepatotoxic meds.  The patient's migraines were addressed with her 
Inderal per rheumatology.  Rheumatology also agreed that it was most likely 
gastroenteritis from the E. coli and the patient will follow up in the 
rheumatology clinic. 
 
DIAGNOSTICS:
 
A retroperitoneal ultrasound showed ______ normal kidneys and bladder.  
Abdominal MRI without contrast was done on **DATE[Aug 07], 2008 that showed no 
inter or extrahepatic ductal violation.  The gallbladder was within normal 
limits without stones.  The common duct size was unremarkable and no filling 
defects seen.
