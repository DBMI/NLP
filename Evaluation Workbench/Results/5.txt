HOSPITAL COURSE 
This **AGE[in 80s]-year-old lady who was admitted with shortness of breath, hypoxemia, 
and altered mental status was admitted and monitored.  She was started on 
BiPAP and she improved well.  Her white count was 18.6 on admission.  She was 
started on Cipro for a probable UTI.   
 
The patient improved clinically and her urine revealed Shiga of greater than 
100,000 colonies and her Cipro was switched over to ceftriaxone and Zithromax 
for a probable left upper lobe pneumonia.  She was rapidly tapered off of her 
BiPAP and was placed on oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula.  
Clinically, she had regular heart sounds and eventually clear lung sounds, 
even though she had bilateral rhonchi and wheezing initially on admission.  
Her abdomen was soft.  Extremities were nontender.  Neurologically, she did 
not have any deficits.   
 
A CT of the chest did not reveal any evidence of PE.  Her blood tests 
revealed a sodium of 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 40, BUN 
25, creatinine 0.9, and a glucose of 319.  Her hemoglobin and hematocrit were 
at 11.6 and 34.7 with a white count of 6.8 and a platelet count of 259.  Her 
BNP was at 183 and a hemoglobin A1C was at 5.8.   
 
The patient was evaluated by pulmonology and cardiology.  She also had an 
echocardiogram that revealed an ejection fraction of 48%. 
 
The patient was stable enough clinically to be transferred to a skilled 
nursing facility at Canterbury for a few more days before she goes back to 
her personal care home.   
 
Condition at the time of discharge is stable.
