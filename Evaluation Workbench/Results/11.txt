ATTEND:  **PLACE, MD

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Salmonella enterocolitis.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:  
1.  Aortic thrombus.
2.  Hypokalemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7.  Pulmonary hypertension.

LIST OF CONSULTANTS:  
1.  Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW] from Cardiology.
2.  Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] from Gastroenterology.
3.  Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] from General Surgery.
4.  Dr. **NAME[RRR QQQ] from Vascular Surgery.

PROCEDURE AND TESTS:  An abdomen and pelvis CT showing and indeterminate-age 
splenic infarct in the inferior pole as well as pan proctocolitis consistent 
with infection, and extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, 
mesenteric arteries, and main renal arteries with aortic thrombus, read as 
possibly floating, but reviewed with Vascular Surgery, who decided that it 
was adherent and its location is at the level of the celiac and SMA origins.  
Ultrasound of the abdominal aorta demonstrates a mural thrombus, which is 
unchanged or marginally larger compared to **DATE[Sep 26], 2008.  Echocardiogram 
showing calcified and restricted aortic valve leaflets, a normal LV and right 
ventricular systolic function, and mild mitral annular calcification.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Aspirin 81 mg once a day.
2.  Citrucel 2 times a day.
3.  Baclofen 10 mg daily.
4.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg three times a day for 7 days.
5.  Plavix 75 mg once a day.
6.  Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg every morning.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day.
8.  MS Contin 30 mg every 12 hours.
9.  Multivitamin with minerals 1 tablet once a day.
10.  Protonix 40 mg once a day.
11.  Actonel as prescribed.
12.  Simvastatin 20 mg every evening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old female with a history of coronary 
artery disease, prior ischemic bowel, hypertension, COPD, and pulmonary 
hypertension who was admitted with Salmonella colitis, found also to have a 
large mural thrombus in her abdominal aorta.  The patient was initially 
presenting with about 2 weeks of nausea and 2 days of explosive diarrhea, 
that did have a presence of blood in her stool, and stool culture did 
eventually grow out Salmonella species group D.  Otherwise, she was negative 
for Clostridium difficile ova and parasites.  She was treated initially with 
some Flagyl empirically, and stool culture grew out Salmonella, at which time 
she was switched over to ciprofloxacin.  She was rehydrated.  Actually, 
really was quite symptom-free after the first night of admission in terms of 
her abdominal pain and nausea.  She did tolerate p.o. food throughout her 
course in the hospital, and her diarrhea did resolve after 3 days.  She was 
initially started on a heparin drip by Vascular Surgery for concern that she 
had floating thrombus in her abdominal aorta; however, further review of the 
scan along with confirmation by abdominal ultrasound indicated this was 
indeed a mural thrombus.  Heparin was discontinued as well as her aspirin and 
Plavix in light of a possible GI bleed; however, it was more likely that this 
was secondary to her colitis as well as her hemorrhoid.  She did have a 
stable hemoglobin, that fluctuated somewhat in the range of 9.7 to 11.3.  
Gastroenterology did see her, but there was no need for any procedures during 
this admission, they will follow up with her with a colonoscopy as an 
outpatient.  Upon identification of the organism causing her colitis, she was 
restarted on her aspirin and Plavix.  She also did an echocardiogram that did 
not reveal any left ventricular thrombus.  Vascular Surgery did consider her 
thrombus stable and she was asymptomatic, with no evidence of ischemic bowel, 
and they did recommend for her to get a chest CT to look for any aortic arch 
thrombi that may have precipitated her splenic infarct; however, this was not 
obtained during this hospitalization.  The patient did also require some 
repletion of her potassium, which had dropped as low as 2.7 without any EKG 
changes, and was 4.7 on the day of discharge.  Additionally, her magnesium 
required repletion.  Electrolytes were otherwise within normal limits, and 
her acute renal failure from dehydration improved from a BUN and creatinine 
of 19 and 0.8 to 7 and 0.7 on the day of discharge.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in stable condition back 
home.

FOLLOWUP:  She is to follow up with her PCP, Dr. **NAME[PPP] within 1 week, she 
is to have a CBC drawn before that appointment.  Additionally, she has a 
colonoscopy scheduled with Dr. **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Jan 26], 
2009, and she will also follow up with her cardiologist, Dr. **NAME[WWW], in 
**DATE[May] 2009.
