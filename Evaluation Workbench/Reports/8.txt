Dear Dr **NAME[XXX]

We had the pleasure of seeing your patient **NAME[YYY] in our **INSTITUTION here at **INSTITUTION of **PLACE for an initial consultation.
**NAME[YYY] is an adorable 2 1/**AGE[birth-12] year old male who was seen in clinic today along
with his sister because of a diagnosis of shigella enteritis. **NAME[YYY] is a
previously healthy male who was relatively well until about the 10th of
**DATE[Dec] when he developed a brief history of fever and vomiting which lasted
for over two days. His maximum temperature was about 101. He then developed
diarrhea which, at that time, was not severe. This was three days prior to a
trip that the family took to Peru. During the two-week visit in Peru he
continued to have mild diarrhea but on return to the United States on **DATE[Dec 
31], he had a period where he continued to have just a few episodes of loose
stools but then his diarrhea got significantly worse on **DATE[Jan 16]. At that
time, he was having in excess of 6 watery stools per day which were greenish
in appearance and did continue but no blood. He had no vomiting or fever at
the time but had significant loss of fluids from his loose stools. His
appetite was also significantly decreased. He had no skin rash and no other
symptoms at that time. He was seen in your office and had a stool culture done
because of the persistence of his diarrhea and his stool culture result was
subsequently positive for shigella. He was started on a ten-day course of oral
ciprofloxacin on Monday of this week, so today would have been his fifth dose.
His father, however, got concerned because he started complaining of ankle and
knee and leg pain and also complained of a headache. He had no skin rash. His
diarrhea has significantly improved and, in fact, had begun to improve even
prior to starting his ciprofloxacin. He has had no stools since yesterday and
he has not had any return of his vomiting. He has no abdominal pain. He does
however still have a significant reduction in his appetite but continues to
drink milk.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
He does have a cough and stuffiness which began just a few days ago. He has no
shortness of breath or wheezing. He has no skin rash or joint swellings. He
has no hematuria or dysuria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
He has no known chronic illnesses and has had no prior hospitalizations.

BIRTH HISTORY
He was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. His birth weight was
about 6 pounds. He was sent home after two days but was readmitted because of
jaundice at which time he was hospitalized for two additional days.

IMMUNIZATIONS
Up-to-date; he received a flu shot.

ALLERGIES
He has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY
Negative for immunodeficiency or recurrent infections.

MEDICATIONS
He currently is receiving oral ciprofloxacin. He has had four days of doses
since Monday but has received no dose today.

SOCIAL HISTORY
**NAME[YYY] lives with his parents and his younger sister. His dad is from Peru and
his mother is from Brazil, so the family visits both countries every two
years. His dad is a teacher at **INSTITUTION. His mom works at Bayer
Corporation.

PHYSICAL EXAM
Temperature 35.9 celsius; heart rate 140 per minute; respiratory rate 28 per
minute. His weight was 15 kg which is in the 75th and 90th percentile. His
height was 94.8 cm which is in the 50th and 90th percentile. General exam - he
was alert, well-appearing, not ill-appearing and in no acute distress. His
hydration status was adequate. HEENT exam - head was normocephalic and
atraumatic. Eyes - he had no conjunctival injection or discharge. Ears - both
tympanic membranes were normal. Nose - he had normal nasal turbinates and no
nasal discharge. Throat was not hyperemic; he had no exudate on his tonsils.
Neck was supple and there was no significant lymphadenopathy. Respiratory -
breath sounds were clear and equal bilaterally. He had no crackles or wheezes.
Cardiovascular - his pulse was regular normal volume. His apex beat was not
displaced. Heart sounds, 1 and 2 were heard and normal and he had no murmurs.
Abdomen was soft and scaphoid. He had no tenderness or masses. He had no
hepatosplenomegaly. Kidneys were not palpable. His bowel sounds were normal.
Musculoskeletal - he had no swelling or tenderness of any of his joints.
Neurological - he was alert, active, cooperative. He had no cranial nerve
deficits. His power and tone in his extremities were normal. Skin - he had no
rash.

LABORATORY DATA
Review of his laboratory data showed a stool culture which was done on
**DATE[Jan 20]/2009 which was positive for shigella sonnei which was sensitive to
ciprofloxacin and resistant to ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim.
He had a stool test also done for ova and parasites and that was negative for
Giardia, cryptosporidium and no ova and parasites were seen on microscopic
exam.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
**NAME[YYY] is a 2 1/**AGE[birth-12] year old male with no chronic illnesses who developed
shigella enteritis. His diarrhea has actually been going on for over a month
prior to his visit to Peru. There was however, a significant change in the
nature of his diarrhea on his return to the United States. It is possible that
he may have had an enteritis by some other organism but then developed a
shigella infection and it is quite likely that this infection occurred during
his visit to Peru. Treatment with ciprofloxacin was appropriate in his case
since his symptoms seem to have been progressing at the time when he was
initially evaluated. Based on **NAME[YYY]'s father's concerns about the
ciprofloxacin and the fact that his symptoms are improving significantly, it
is reasonable to discontinue his ciprofloxacin. He has had four days' worth
which will help a long way in decreasing colonization in his stool and so I
feel comfortable stopping the ciprofloxacin at this point in time. He has
reports that the Health Department of Allegheny has been calling the home
daily to check up on them and they are due to have a repeat stool culture to
ensure clearance prior to the return to daycare. We advised that Monday would
be a reasonable time to have this done so that they could return to daycare as
soon as possible, especially since his diarrhea has stopped.

Thank you for allowing us to take part in **NAME[YYY]'s care. It was a pleasure to
see both him and his sister. If you have any questions regarding the
recommendations to day, feel free to contact us and we will be more than happy
to discuss them with you.
